# Recipes

## Overview

This project is a simple HTML and CSS web page that features multiple food recipes. Users can click on a recipe to view its picture, description, ingredients, and instructions on how to prepare the dish.

I did this project as part of [The Odin Project Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).

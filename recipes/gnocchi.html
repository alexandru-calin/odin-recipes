    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Gnocchi is simple to make with just three ingredients: mashed potato,
      flour, and egg. This recipe is one my family has used for generations.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><p>2 potatoes, peeled</p></li>
      <li><p>2 cups all-purpose flour</p></li>
      <li><p>1 egg</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

          Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; add potatoes and cook
          until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, and mash
          with a fork or potato masher.

          Combine 1 cup mashed potato, flour, and egg in a large bowl. Knead
          until dough forms a ball. Shape small portions of the dough into long
          "snakes". On a floured surface, cut snakes into 1/2-inch pieces.

          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drop in gnocchi
          and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until gnocchi have risen to the top;
          drain and serve.
